## Overview

The job is to replicate a webpage with one's own style of approach.

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

I Started with HTML structure and the proceeded to the CSS whereby I styled it based on the 1440px screen size first. Then I styled it for the 375px optimal screen size.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS properties

### Continued development

I have challenge with box model properties in the css so positioning and arrangment are areas I want to focus on more. So I would like to refine that more so that I can create better designs.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for any HTML or CSS tags or properties that I was looking for. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
